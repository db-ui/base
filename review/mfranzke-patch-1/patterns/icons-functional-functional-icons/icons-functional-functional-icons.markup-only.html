<p>Please keep in mind that it's optional to set the variant combination of size (24) and style (outline) as these are defined as default.<br>In case that you'll need another default in your project, you could overwrite the defaults by overwriting the <code>$icon-size</code> and <code>$icon-style</code> SCSS variables.</p>
