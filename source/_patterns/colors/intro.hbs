    <h1>Color System</h1>
    <p>DB UX Design Guidelines 3.0 introduce a complete new set of color variables that follow some rules to work with.</p>
    <p>Each accent color (primary, secondary, information, etc.) is provided in a group of six compatible colors of different tones for pairing, defining emphasis, and visual expression.</p>
    <p>Background colors define their own foreground color by so named on-colors. For using the DB Design System with SCSS, we provide a wide range of SCSS placeholders and utility 
        classes that automatically style e.g. text and links based on their current background color. For more information have a look at the usage section.</p>
 

    <h2>Color Scheme – Primary (Example)</h2>
    <p>The following example shows the available colors for the primary brand color. 
        Each defined color has an interactive mode which means that colors for hover and pressed states are defined.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary</b> – base key color</li>
        <li><b>On Primary</b> – is applied to content (icons, text, etc.) that sits on top of primary</li>
        <li><b>Primary Background-Light</b> – background color for current key color. Only used for backrounds.</li>
        <li><b>Primary Background-Transparent</b> – Transparent or semi transparent backgrounds for current key color, e.g. used for form field backgrounds.</li>
        <li><b>On Primary Background</b> – is applied to content (icons, text, etc.) that sits on top of primary background colors (background light or transparent).</li>
        <li><b>On Primary Background Weak</b> – is applied to content (icons, text, etc.) that sits on top of primary background colors (background light or transparent) and is a variant to weaken content on primary backgrounds.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Neutral Color Scheme</h2>
    <p>The neutral color palette exists of six color variants plus two on-color variants (default and weak). In contrast to key colors like primary, neutral colors can only be used for backgrounds.</p>
