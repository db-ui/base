title: Deutsche Bahn Logo

Please find a lot of more information regarding our logo and how to use it within the Marketingportal: <https://marketingportal.extranet.deutschebahn.com/marketingportal/Design-Anwendungen/DB-UX-Design-System/Design-fuer-Apps-Web/Logo>

#### Adapt logos colors (background and fill)

You could easily change the line-colors of the logo as well as the background color by defining different color values for both CSS variables:

- `--db-logo-color`
- `--db-logo-backgroundcolor`

The fallback for an undefined `--db-logo-color` is our DB Red (`#f01414`), and `--db-logo-backgroundcolor` would fall back to `transparent`, which is the general background defined by brand.
